# Does the evaluation mention the contribution's sustainability in the evaluation's summary?

## Methods 

This approach relies on that our parsing mechanism was able to locate the executive summary in the table of contents. Given that this is the case we simply search for variations of the base form of the DAC criteria i.e. words such as sustainability or sustainable in the underlying text.

## Results

The results indicated a correct match with EBA2017:12 in 48 out of 58.


## Caveats

When comparing the results that did not match between our approach and EBA2017:12 we found the following caveat in EBA2017:12.

* For evaluation 2014:28, the EBA2017:12 reports that sustainability was not mention - but on page 11 - we find the sentence: `The  mere  fact  that  the  government  itself  has  formulated  programs  for  the development of the state registration of real property rights attest to the longevity and sustainable commitment to pursue the effectiveness of the sector.`
