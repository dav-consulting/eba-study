# Adresses a variation of question 24 and 25
    * Does the evaluation mention the contribution's sustainability in the evaluation's recommendations? 
    * Does the evaluation give recommendations for how the contribution can improve its sustainability?

## Methods 

This approach relies on finding a recommendation section in the table of contents. If the section mentions sustainability we simply assume that since this text passage is under a recommendation section it should be the case that it also discusses the potential for improvements.

## Results

## Caveats

This question was difficult to interpret from the underlying data in EBA2017:12. The underlying data seems to answer a variation of the above two questions. Hence we thus decided to rely on the simple approach of trying to identify the DAC criteria in the recommendation settings.
